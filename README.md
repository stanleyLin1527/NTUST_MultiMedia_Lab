In this repo, I show you what I have done in MultiMedia Lab.  
It is basically image processing using opencv:  
  - Quiz1: Implement RGB to GREYSCALE        (it is "test_Opencv" folder)
  - Quiz2: Implement 5 * 5 smoothing method
  - Quiz3: Find the watermark in the image. The watermark is the LSB in the image.
  - Quiz4: Counting how many stones are there in the image.
  - Quiz5: Implement histogram equalization
